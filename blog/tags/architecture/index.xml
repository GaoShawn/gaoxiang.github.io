      <description>The android architecture consists of five main layers, including Android application, Android Framework, Dalvik virtual machine, user-space native code and Linux kernel. The first two layers are developed in java, and executed in Dalvik virtual machine(DVM). DVM is a register-based VM that interprets the Dalvik Executable(DEX) byte code format. In turn, DVM relies on the functionalities provided by a number of supporting native code libraries. The user-space native code components include system services such as DBus, networking services such as dhcpd, supporting libraries such as WebKit and OpenSSL.</description>
